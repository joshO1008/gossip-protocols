# The Efficiency of Distributed Gossip Protocols

The aim of a gossip protocol is to distribute information throughout a network of agents, when initially each agent only knows a single unique piece of information. This project is designed to provide a simulator in which the user is able to perform various gossip protocols in Python (namely ANY, CO, LNS, TOK and SPI).

## Getting Started

Note that an understanding of gossip protocols would be beneficial before viewing the code. 

### Dependencies

This code utilises various python modules, most notably the Network X module which is used to model the distribution of agents using mathematical graph theory. The full list of modules is as follows:
- networkx (as nx)
- matplotlib.pyplot (as plt)
- numpy (as np)
- math
- time
- copy
- pickle

### Installing

Simply load all of the files related to this project in Python 3, prefereably using an IDE such as Spyder. Each file contains desrciptions of their contents, as well as descriptions of each functions input/output. 

### Executing program

A detailed description of the execution process is given in the dissertation provied.
